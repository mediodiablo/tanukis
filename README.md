# I used MultiTerm Astro as my starting point

**MultiTerm** is an Astro blog theme designed for coders who love their color schemes. Easily theme your whole website with your favorite color schemes and have your prose rendered with a nod to the aesthetics of raw markdown.

Check out the live example site [here](https://multiterm.stelclementine.com)!

## âœ¨ Features

- **Amazing Theme Selection**: Personalize your blog's appearance with your favorite editor color scheme. Pick your favorite [Shiki themes](https://expressive-code.com/guides/themes/#available-themes) bundled with Expressive Code.
- **Dark/Light/Auto Theme Mode**: Choose any two Shiki themes and use the standard light/dark/auto model for automatically adapting to your reader's theme preferences with button in the site header.
- **Multiple Theme Mode**: Choose three (or all 59!) Shiki themes and allow your reader to choose their favorite from a dialog menu opened from a button in the header. Every element seamlessly changes color interactively using the magic of CSS variables.
- **Markdown Extensions**: Admonitions, auto-generated TOC that sticks to the side on large screens, emoji shortcodes, KaTeX math, MDX, and reading time estimates. See the example site's [Showing Off Blog Features](https://multiterm.stelclementine.com/posts/showing-off-blog-features) post.
