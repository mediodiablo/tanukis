Someone said that, in the first five years, the one and only role of a parent is to keep his/her child alive.

Fortunately, that specific directive has already been perfected through evolution and ships as part of our firmware. At least based on my direct experience.

We are visiting my wife's parents this week in a different city. They have a pool in the backyard.

My son (K, age: 4) and my daughter (A, age: 2.5) somehow find an ancient tricycle that belonged to my wife. They start "taking turns" driving it around the pool.

Grandma (age: 69) is following them closely, but the kids are fast.

I am about ready to leave for work (we have an office in this city). I go to the backyard to say bye to them, and I see them move quickly from "taking turns" to "it's **my** turn!".

A tugging battle ensues. After a couple of seconds, K pushes A just enough for her to lose balance and fall in. It's the deep end of the pool. Grandma is two steps from them but hesitates.

She said something like "Oh no!" but I couldn't hear because I was already under the water.

It's fascinating how the directive puts one immediately in motion. No frontal lobe involved. Just action.

Clothes are in the dryer now.
