However mundane, trivial, and dull people think their weekly updates are, I find them quite interesting and stimulating. Unlike social media posts, there's no performative cover, no photo filter. Just people living and writing about their normal lives.

Life is hard. People feel a little depressed at times. Times does its thing. But everything gets better always. Odysseus makes it back to Ithaka.

Some of the blogs with week notes that come to mind:
- [netigen](https://netigen.com/tags/week-notes)
- [jedda](https://notes.jeddacp.com/blog/?q=weekNotes)
- [flamed](https://flamedfury.com/tags/monthly%20recap/) -- not weekly but monthly, and also updates about daily life at random intervals

I'm thinking about starting my own stream of unfiltered, mundane, and dull week notes sometime soon. Perhaps this Sunday night when the kids and my wife are sleeping and silence visits the house.
