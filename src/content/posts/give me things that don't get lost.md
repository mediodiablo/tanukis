Ok, I just completed my third day of garage gym training in four days. Before then, I had let two months go by without doing any "move the body" activity (other than short hikes on weekends).

Two months had never happened before, but no big deal, it's not the end of the world... or the end of the **war**.

## the war, old man

See, after a certain age, the body enters a war. The enemy is out there, hungry and relentless. Every week that goes by without moving the body (by the way, walking the dog doesn't count), without strength training in particular, we let the enemy get closer.

The idea is to keep the enemy far away from the city. To prolong as much as possible the final siege, the barbarians at the gate, and the inevitable breaking through of Mehmed II.

Why did I stop? Because it's easy to blame my family for not giving me the time and space I need to stay healthy. I pointed the finger at them a couple of times, and then inertia took care of the rest.

## exercise program

Anyway, here is the program that I want to stick to for the next 60 days or so. I'll pick any combination of seven exercises, and do two to three sets of each.

- kettlebell swings
- squats
- lunges
- romanian deadlifts
- kettlebell thrusters
- turkish getups
- military press
- active hangs
- pull ups
- active hangs
- barbell rows
- push ups
- dips
- rollouts (ab wheel)

## inspiration

Byzantium lasted 1123 years before its fall in 1453 AD. It was sieged many times over the centuries, but it did not collapse.

Time to visit St. Sophia and pray for longevity.
