this is Tanuki San and I'm launching this website on September 5, 2025. That is a couple of days before my birthday.

I wasn't always in California, but my wife and kids are SoCal natives.

We love it here.

The day before yesterday, I went surfing in Third Point. The waves were good for someone who hadn't been in the water for almost four years.

Things are harder with toddlers around so, instead of dealing with surfing-related logistics, I figured I could just sit down and ramble on the keyboard.

Oyasumi.
